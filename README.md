# Backstage Operator

## The Goal
The Goal of [Backstage](https://backstage.io) Operator project is creating Kubernetes Operator for configuring, installing and synchronizing Backstage instance on Kubernetes/OpenShift. 
The initial target is in support of Red Hat's assemblies of Backstage - specifically supporting [dynamic-plugins](https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-showcase/blob/main/showcase-docs/dynamic-plugins.md) on OpenShift. This includes [Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)](https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh) but may be flexible enough to install any compatible Backstage instance on Kubernetes. See additional information under [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).
The Operator provides clear and flexible configuration options to satisfy a wide range of expectations, from "no  configuration for default quick start" to "highly customized configuration for production".

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. You can use [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) or [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) for local testing, or deploy to a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

To test it on minikube from the source code:

Both **kubectl** and **minikube** must be installed. See [tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

1.  Get your copy of Operator from GitHub: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator
```
2. Deploy Operator on the minikube cluster:
```sh
cd <your-rhdh-operator-project-dir>
make deploy
```
you can check if the Operator pod is up by running 
```sh
kubectl get pods -n backstage-system
It should be something like:
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
backstage-controller-manager-cfc44bdfd-xzk8g   2/2     Running   0          32s
```
3. Create Backstage Custom resource on some namespace (make sure this namespace exists)
```sh
kubectl -n <your-namespace> apply -f examples/bs1.yaml
```
you can check if the Operand pods are up by running
```sh
kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace>
It should be something like:
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
backstage-bs1-6c98c4dd6d-9wbgg   1/1     Running   3 (34m ago)   34m
backstage-psql-bs1-0             1/1     Running   0             34m

```

5. Port forward Backstage pod/port (destination port is **17007** in this example) and get URL for access Backstage.
Backstage-pod-name has a following pattern: **backstage-<name-of-CR>-<random-sequence>**
Taking previous item, your backstage-pod-name would be `backstage-bs1-6c98c4dd6d-9wbgg`

```sh
minikube service -n <your-namespace> backstage --url
kubectl port-forward -n <your-namespace> <backstage-pod-name> 17007:7007

Output:
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:17007 -> 7007
Forwarding from [::1]:17007 -> 7007
```
5. Access your Backstage instance in a browser using http://localhost:17007

## Telemetry data collection

The telemetry data collection feature is enabled by default. The default configuration uses image with backstage-plugin-analytics-provider-segment plugin enabled and configured. To disable this and to learn what data is being collected, see https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-showcase/blob/main/showcase-docs/getting-started.md#telemetry-collection
