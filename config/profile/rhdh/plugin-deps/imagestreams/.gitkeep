# This directory contains ImageStream manifests for OCP registry.redhat.io access.
# ImageStream manifests are auto-generated by the nightly-imagestreams.yaml workflow.
# 
# When the operator runs on OpenShift, it creates these ImageStreams which allow
# the OCP internal registry to import and cache images from registry.redhat.io
# using the cluster's pull secret. The init container can then pull these images
# from the internal registry without needing explicit auth credentials.
#
# Do not manually edit files in this directory - they are auto-generated.
