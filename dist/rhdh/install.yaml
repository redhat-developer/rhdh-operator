          Backstage is the Schema for the Red Hat Developer Hub backstages API.

                      References to existing app-configs ConfigMap objects, that will be mounted as files in the specified mount path.
                      Each element can be a reference to any ConfigMap or Secret,
                      and will be mounted inside the main application container under a specified mount directory.
                      Additionally, each file will be passed as a `--config /mount/path/to/configmap/key` to the
                      main container args in the order of the entries defined in the AppConfigs list.
                      But bear in mind that for a single ConfigMap element containing several filenames,
                      the order in which those files will be appended to the main container args cannot be guaranteed.
                      So if you want to pass multiple app-config files, it is recommended to pass one ConfigMap per app-config file.

                          Otherwise, only the specified key will be mounted as a file.
                          Bear in mind not to put sensitive data in those ConfigMaps. Instead, your app-config content can reference
                          environment variables (which you can set with the ExtraEnvs field) and/or include extra files (see the ExtraFiles field).

                      References to existing app-configs ConfigMap objects, that will be mounted as files in the specified mount path.
                      Each element can be a reference to any ConfigMap or Secret,
                      and will be mounted inside the main application container under a specified mount directory.
                      Additionally, each file will be passed as a `--config /mount/path/to/configmap/key` to the
                      main container args in the order of the entries defined in the AppConfigs list.
                      But bear in mind that for a single ConfigMap element containing several filenames,
                      the order in which those files will be appended to the main container args cannot be guaranteed.
                      So if you want to pass multiple app-config files, it is recommended to pass one ConfigMap per app-config file.

                          Otherwise, only the specified key will be mounted as a file.
                          Bear in mind not to put sensitive data in those ConfigMaps. Instead, your app-config content can reference
                          environment variables (which you can set with the ExtraEnvs field) and/or include extra files (see the ExtraFiles field).

      description: >-
        This task can be used to perform git operations.

        Git command that needs to be run can be passed as a script to
        the task. This task needs authentication to git in order to push
        after the git operation.

      workspaces:
        - name: source
          description: A workspace that contains the fetched git repository.

        - name: input
          optional: true
          description: |
            An optional workspace that contains the files that need to be added to git. You can
            access the workspace from your script using `$(workspaces.input.path)`, for instance:

            cp $(workspaces.input.path)/file_that_i_want .
            git add file_that_i_want
            # etc

        - name: ssh-directory
          optional: true
          description: |
            A .ssh directory with private key, known_hosts, config, etc. Copied to
            the user's home before git commands are executed. Used to authenticate
            with the git remote when performing the clone. Binding a Secret to this
            Workspace is strongly recommended over other volume types.

        - name: basic-auth
          optional: true
          description: |
            A Workspace containing a .gitconfig and .git-credentials file. These
            will be copied to the user's home before any git commands are run. Any
            other files in this Workspace are ignored. It is strongly recommended
            to use ssh-directory over basic-auth whenever possible and to bind a
            Secret to this Workspace over other volume types.
