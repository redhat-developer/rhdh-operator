== Installing CI builds of Red Hat Developer Hub

*Prerequisites*

* You are logged in as an administrator on the OpenShift web console.
* You have configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create an application. See the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/applications/index.html[Red Hat OpenShift documentation on Building applications] for more details.

*Procedure*

. Run the link:../scripts/install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh[installation script] to create the RHDH Operator CatalogSource in your cluster. By default, it installs the Release Candidate or GA version (from the `release-1.yy` branch), but the `--next` option allows to install the current development build (from the `main` branch). For example:
+
[source,console]
----
cd /tmp
curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/main/.rhdh/scripts/install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh
chmod +x install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh

# install catalog source and operator subscription, for the latest downstream stable, RC or GA build from the release-1.yy branch
./install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh --latest --install-operator rhdh  

# OR, install catalog source and operator subscription, for the next donwstream CI build from the main branch
./install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh --next --install-operator rhdh  
----

. If you did not create a subscription in the previous step, you can do so now. In the *Administrator* perspective of the OpenShift web console, go to *Operators* â†’ *OperatorHub*, search for Red Hat Developer Hub, and install the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator.
