== Mirroring Red Hat Developer Hub Dynamic Plugins for Disconnected Environments

Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) uses dynamic plugins that are distributed as OCI (Open Container Initiative) artifacts. In disconnected or restricted environments, these plugin artifacts must be mirrored to a registry accessible by your cluster.

This guide explains how to use the link:./../scripts/mirror-plugins.sh[mirror-plugins.sh] script to mirror dynamic plugin OCI artifacts for deployments in restricted environments.

=== Prerequisites

The following tools are required to run the mirroring script:

* `skopeo >= 1.20` - For multi-arch image operations and manifest conversion. See link:https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/main/install.md[Installing Skopeo].
* `tar >= 1.35` - GNU tar for extracting image layers.
* `jq >= 1.7` - For JSON parsing and manipulation. See link:https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/[Download jq].
* `podman >= 5.6` - For building catalog index images. See link:https://podman.io/docs/installation[Podman Installation Instructions].

=== Plugin Source Options

The script supports multiple ways to specify which plugins to mirror:

* *Plugin Catalog Index* (`--plugin-index`) - A catalog index (e.g., `oci://quay.io/rhdh/plugin-catalog-index:1.9`) that contains references to all available plugins for a specific RHDH version.
* *Plugin List File* (`--plugin-list`) - A text file containing OCI URLs, one per line. Comments starting with `#` are ignored.
* *Direct Plugin URLs* (`--plugins`) - Space-separated list of plugin OCI URLs specified directly on the command line.

You can combine multiple sources in a single mirroring operation. The script will automatically deduplicate plugins.

=== Procedures

[#_mirroring_all_plugins_from_catalog_index]
==== Mirroring all plugins from a catalog index (Connected Environment)

Use this procedure when you have network access to both the source registry (quay.io) and your target mirror registry from the same host.

. Authenticate to both the source registry (`podman login quay.io`) and your target registry. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/RegistryAuthentication[Red Hat Container Registry Authentication].

. Run the mirroring script with the catalog index (replace `1.9` with your desired RHDH version):
+
[source,console]
----
bash mirror-plugins.sh \
    --plugin-index oci://quay.io/rhdh/plugin-catalog-index:1.9 \
    --to-registry registry.example.com
----

The script will:

* Download and parse the catalog index
* Extract all plugin references
* Mirror each plugin to your registry
* Rebuild the catalog index with updated registry references
* Generate a summary file: `rhdh-plugin-mirroring-summary.txt`

[#_fully_disconnected_workflow]
==== Mirroring to a disconnected or restricted network environment

Use this procedure for OpenShift clusters in disconnected or restricted network environments where direct access to external registries is not available. This two-phase process involves exporting plugins on a connected host and importing them in the restricted network.

*Prerequisites*

* A connected host with internet access and sufficient disk space for plugin artifacts
* A method to transfer files to the restricted network (removable media, approved transfer process, etc.)
* A bastion host or workstation within the restricted network with access to the internal container registry
* Valid credentials for quay.io (on the connected host) and your internal registry (on the restricted network host)

*Procedure*

*Phase 1: Export plugins (Connected Host)*

. On a host with internet access, authenticate to the source registry:
+
[source,console]
----
podman login quay.io
----

. Export all plugins to a local directory:
+
[source,console]
----
bash mirror-plugins.sh \
    --plugin-index oci://quay.io/rhdh/plugin-catalog-index:1.9 \
    --to-dir /tmp/rhdh-plugins
----
+
The export directory will contain:
+
* `plugins/` - All plugin OCI artifacts organized by registry path
* `catalog-index/` - Extracted catalog index content
* `rhdh-plugin-mirroring-summary.txt` - Mapping of all mirrored plugins

. Transfer the entire `/tmp/rhdh-plugins` directory to your restricted network environment using your organization's approved transfer process.

*Phase 2: Import plugins (Restricted Network Environment)*

. On a bastion host or workstation within the restricted network that has access to your internal registry, authenticate to the registry:
+
[source,console]
----
podman login internal-registry.example.com
----

. Import and push the plugins to your internal registry:
+
[source,console]
----
bash mirror-plugins.sh \
    --from-dir /tmp/rhdh-plugins \
    --to-registry internal-registry.example.com
----
+
The script will:
+
* Read the original plugin mappings from the summary file
* Push all plugins to your internal registry
* Rebuild and push the catalog index with updated registry references
