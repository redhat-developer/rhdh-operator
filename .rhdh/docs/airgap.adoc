== Deploying the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) Operator and RHDH instances in disconnected environments

A disconnected or restricted environment is an environment that does not have full access to the internet. So the cluster will not be able to pull any images from public registries like the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.

Deploying the RHDH Operator and running RHDH requires the following public resources:

* Operator images (bundle, operator, catalog)
* Operands images (RHDH, PostgreSQL)

To make these resources available, you will need to replace them with their copies in a mirror registry accessible by the cluster.

We provide a helper script that mirrors all the necessary images and does all the heavy lifting to ensure those images will be used when installing the RHDH Operator and creating RHDH instances.

This requires a target mirror registry, which you should already have if your cluster is already operating on a restricted network. If not and if you have an OpenShift cluster, you may want to expose and leverage the internal cluster registry.

Note that you can mirror the images to a mirror registry in a link:#_partially_disconnected_environments[partially disconnected environment] or in a link:#_fully_disconnected_environments[fully disconnected environment].

Below are the prerequisites regardless of the target disconnected environment.

*Prerequisites*

* `GNU sed`. See link:https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/[GNU sed].
* (*Optional*) `oc-mirror` (the OpenShift Client mirror plugin) if you want to mirror using `oc-mirror` on OpenShift. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#installation-oc-mirror-installing-plugin_about-installing-oc-mirror-v2[Installing the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin].
* `Skopeo 1.17+`. See link:https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/main/install.md[Installing Skopeo].
* `umoci`. See link:https://github.com/opencontainers/umoci#install[Install].
* `yq v4.44+`. See link:https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install[Install].
* (*Required on non-OpenShift clusters*) The cluster needs to have the Operator Lifecycle Manager installed and already working in disconnected environments. See link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/install/install.md#installing-olm[Installing OLM].
* (*Required on non-OpenShift clusters*) A mirror registry reachable from the cluster.

=== Mirroring and deploying the RHDH Operator

[#_partially_disconnected_environments]
==== Partially disconnected environments

In a partially disconnected environment, you (or the machine where you are running the mirroring tool) has direct access to the mirror registry.

Besides the prerequisites listed above, you will also need:

*Prerequisites*

* An active `oc registry` session to the `registry.redhat.io` Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. See link:https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Red Hat Container Registry Authentication].
* An active `skopeo` session with administrative access to the target mirror registry is required. See link:https://github.com/containers/skopeo#authenticating-to-a-registry[Authenticating to a registry]. The script can detect if you are connected to an OpenShift cluster and will automatically expose the cluster registry, unless you specify the target registry to mirror to.
* `opm`. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/cli_tools/opm-cli#olm-about-opm_cli-opm-install[Installing the opm CLI].
* `podman 5.3+`. See link:https://podman.io/docs/installation[Podman Installation Instructions].

**Procedure**

. Download and execute the mirroring script to install the RHDH Operator catalog and mirror the related images: link:../scripts/prepare-restricted-environment.sh[`prepare-restricted-environment.sh`]
+
[source,console]
----
#
# For GA releases
#

# NOTES:
# 1. Omit `--to-registry` if you are connected against an OpenShift cluster and want the script to expose the internal cluster registry and use that for mirroring.
# 2. Omit `--use-oc-mirror` if you don't want to use `oc-mirror`. `oc-mirror` makes sense only if targetting OpenShift.

bash prepare-restricted-environment.sh \
    [--to-registry my.registry.example.com/namespace] \
    [--use-oc-mirror true]

#----------------------------------------------------

#
# For CI Builds
#

# NOTES:
# 1. Omit `--to-registry` if you are connected against an OpenShift cluster and want the script to expose the internal cluster registry and use that for mirroring.
# 2. Omit `--use-oc-mirror` if you don't want to use `oc-mirror`. `oc-mirror` makes sense only if targetting OpenShift.
# 3. Specify `*` for `--filter-versions` to disable version filtering. It will include all channels of the rhdh package from the index image.

bash prepare-restricted-environment.sh \
    --index-image "quay.io/rhdh/iib:next-v4.18-x86_64" \
    [--filter-versions '*'] \
    [--to-registry my.registry.example.com/namespace] \
    [--use-oc-mirror true]
----
+
Be patient, the script can take several minutes to complete. It will automatically install the RHDH Operator.

*Verification*

* On OpenShift, you should see the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator in the list of Installed Operators in the web console.
* In a vanilla Kubernetes cluster, you can check the list of Pods running in the `rhdh-operator` namespace:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl -n rhdh-operator get pods

[#_fully_disconnected_environments]
==== Fully disconnected environments

In a fully disconnected environment, you usually need to connect to an intermediate bastion host or may even need to move physically there in order to reach the target mirror registry. In this context, you will need to follow the process below:

. link:#_mirroring_to_disk[*Mirror all the required images to disk*].
. *Manually transfer* the mirror folder from the step above to the network of the disconnected mirror registry.
. In the disconnected environment, link:#_mirroring_from_disk[*mirror the images from disk*] to the target mirror registry and install the operator.

[#_mirroring_to_disk]
===== Mirroring to disk

Besides the prerequisites listed above, you will also need:

*Prerequisites*

* An active `oc registry` session to the `registry.redhat.io` Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. See link:https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Red Hat Container Registry Authentication].
* `opm`. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/cli_tools/opm-cli#olm-about-opm_cli-opm-install[Installing the opm CLI].
* `podman 5.3+`. See link:https://podman.io/docs/installation[Podman Installation Instructions].

**Procedure**

. Download and execute the mirroring script to mirror the related images to disk: link:../scripts/prepare-restricted-environment.sh[`prepare-restricted-environment.sh`]

    [--filter-versions '*'] \
    [--use-oc-mirror true]
----
+
Be patient, the script can take several minutes to complete. It will pull all the necessary images into the directory specified in `--to-dir`.

. Now transfer the directory specified in `--to-dir` to your disconnected environment.

[#_mirroring_from_disk]
===== Mirroring from disk

This needs to be executed on a machine which has access to both the cluster and the target mirror registry in your fully disconnected environment.

Besides the prerequisites listed above, you will also need on this machine:

*Prerequisites*

* `podman 5.3+`. See link:https://podman.io/docs/installation[Podman Installation Instructions].

**Procedure**

NOTE: If you used `oc-mirror` to mirror to disk, you must also use `oc-mirror` when mirroring from disk, since `oc-mirror` uses a different folder layout.

. Download and execute the mirroring script to install the RHDH Operator catalog and mirror the related images: link:../scripts/prepare-restricted-environment.sh[`prepare-restricted-environment.sh`]
+
[source,console]
----

# NOTES:
# 1. Omit `--to-registry` if you are connected against an OpenShift cluster and want the script to expose the internal cluster registry and use that for mirroring.
# 2. Omit `--use-oc-mirror` if you don't want to use `oc-mirror`. `oc-mirror` makes sense only if targetting OpenShift.

bash prepare-restricted-environment.sh \
    --from-dir /absolute/path/to/my/mirror/folder \
    [--to-registry my.registry.example.com/namespace] \
    [--use-oc-mirror true]
----
+
Be patient, the script can take several minutes to complete. It will automatically install the RHDH Operator.

*Verification*

* On OpenShift, you should see the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator in the list of Installed Operators in the web console.
* In a vanilla Kubernetes cluster, you can check the list of Pods running in the `rhdh-operator` namespace:

=== Deploying RHDH

Once the Operator has been installed in your disconnected cluster, you can proceed to deploying an Operator-backed instance of RHDH.

==== OpenShift

*Procedure*

. Create a namespace project to be used by your Backstage instance.
For more information about creating a project in OpenShift, see the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/applications/projects/working-with-projects.html#creating-a-project-using-the-web-console_projects[Red Hat OpenShift documentation].
. Switch to the *Developer* perspective in your Red Hat OpenShift web console.
. Click *+Add*.
. From the *Developer Catalog* panel, click *Operator Backed*.
. Search for _Backstage_ in the search bar and select the *Backstage* card.
. Click *Create*.
. Click *Create* and wait for the database and Red Hat Developer Hub to start.
. Click the *Open URL* option to start using the Red Hat Developer Hub platform.
+
image::images/rhdh_from_operator.png[RHDH from Operator]
. See link:openshift.adoc#_configurations_for_operator_backed_rhdh[Configurations for Operator-backed RHDH] for further details about configuring your RHDH instance.

==== Kubernetes

On a vanilla Kubernetes, you can create a Custom Resource (CR) using `kubectl`, like so:

[source,yaml]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl -n rhdh-operator apply -f -
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3
kind: Backstage
metadata:
  name: developer-hub
spec:
  application:
    route:
      enabled: false
  database:
    enableLocalDb: true
EOF
----

Note that if you are creating the CR above in a different namespace, you will probably need to add the right pull secrets to be able to pull the images from your mirror registry. You can do so by patching the default service account in your namespace, like so:

[source,console]
----
kubectl -n $YOUR_NAMESPACE patch serviceaccount default \
    -p '{"imagePullSecrets": [{"name": "$YOUR_PULL_SECRET_NAME"}]}'
----

More details about image pull secrets in https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/
